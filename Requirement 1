### Lab Environment Setup:

1. **OWASP Juice Shop VM IP Configuration:**
   - Open a terminal on the OWASP Juice Shop VM and execute:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
     ```

   - Update the file with the following content:
     ```yaml
     network:
       ethernets:
         enp0s3:
           dhcp4: yes
         enp0s8:
           addresses: [192.168.123.1/24]
     ```

   - Save the file and apply the changes:
     ```bash
     sudo netplan apply
     ```

2. **Kali Linux VM IP Configuration:**
   - Open a terminal on the Kali Linux VM and execute:
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
     ```

   - Update the file with the following content:
     ```yaml
     network:
       ethernets:
         eth0:
           dhcp4: yes
         eth1:
           addresses: [192.168.123.10/24]
     ```

   - Save the file and apply the changes:
     ```bash
     sudo netplan apply
     ```

3. **Ping Test Between Kali Linux and OWASP Juice Shop:**
   - On Kali Linux, ping the OWASP Juice Shop VM:
     ```bash
     ping 192.168.123.1
     ```

   - On OWASP Juice Shop VM, ping Kali Linux:
     ```bash
     ping 192.168.123.10
     ```

   - Observe successful ping responses.

### Lab Notebook Conclusion:

The OWASP Juice Shop environment has been successfully set up with the specified IP addresses. Both the OWASP Juice Shop VM and the Kali Linux VM are communicating on the internal network. The next steps involve conducting functionality testing and preparing for security testing as outlined in the lab requirements.

## Next Steps:
Proceed to Requirement 2 - OWASP Juice Shop Functionality Testing.
