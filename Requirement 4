## Exploiting SQL Injection Vulnerability

1. **Research SQL Injection:**
   - Reviewed OWASP SQL Injection documentation for understanding.

2. **Explore the Target Page:**
   - Visited [https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part2/injection.html](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part2/injection.html).

3. **Identify SQL Injection Points:**
   - Identified a login page as a potential input point.

4. **Craft SQL Injection Payloads:**
   - Prepared payloads including email = `' OR 1=1 --` and password = `a`.

5. **Inject Payloads:**
   - Injected payloads into the login page.

6. **Observe Effects:**
   - Observed changes in displayed data and response messages.
   - Checked for any signs of successful SQL Injection.

7. **Capture Exploitation Process:**
   - Documented the injection process and modifications made to the payload.
   - Recorded changes in the application's behavior.

8. **Retrieve Data (Optional):**
   - Attempted to extract data using payloads like `' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`.

9. **Report Findings:**
   - Notified instructor of successful SQL Injection exploitation.
   - Provided details of injection points, payloads used, and observed impact.
