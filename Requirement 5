## Exploiting Broken Access Control Vulnerability

1. **Research Broken Access Control:**
   - Reviewed OWASP Broken Access Control documentation for understanding.

2. **Explore the Target Page:**
   - Visited [https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part2/broken-access-control.html](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part2/broken-access-control.html).

3. **Identify Broken Access Control Points:**
   - Identified a user profile page as a potential access control point.

4. **Attempt Unauthorized Access:**
   - Attempted to access user profile pages without proper authorization.
   - Modified URLs and parameters to bypass access controls.

5. **Observe Effects:**
   - Observed changes in displayed data and response messages.
   - Checked for any signs of successful exploitation of Broken Access Control.

6. **Capture Exploitation Process:**
   - Documented the unauthorized access attempts and modifications made to URLs.
   - Recorded changes in the application's behavior.

7. **Perform Unauthorized Actions:**
   - Attempted to manipulate parameters to access other users' data.
   - Checked for the ability to perform unauthorized actions.

8. **Report Findings:**
   - Notified instructor of successful Broken Access Control exploitation.
   - Provided details of access control points tested, actions attempted, and observed impact.

## Next Steps:
Proceed to Requirement 6 - Exploit an Authentication Bypass vulnerability.
