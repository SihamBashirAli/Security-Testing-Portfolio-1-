## Exploiting Broken Authentication Vulnerability

1. **Research Broken Authentication:**
   - Reviewed OWASP Broken Authentication documentation for understanding.

2. **Explore the Target Page:**
   - Visited [https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part2/broken-authentication.html](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part2/broken-authentication.html).

3. **Identify Broken Authentication Points:**
   - Identified login pages and password reset functionalities.

4. **Attempt Default Credentials:**
   - Attempted to log in using default credentials (e.g., admin/admin).
   - Checked for any signs of successful authentication.

5. **Brute Force Login:**
   - Used Hydra to perform a brute force attack on the login page.
   - Recorded results of successful or unsuccessful attempts.

6. **Check for Weak Password Policies:**
   - Attempted password reset for known users.
   - Checked if the application enforces strong password policies.

7. **Session Management:**
   - Checked for weaknesses in session management, such as session tokens in URLs.
   - Attempted to manipulate session tokens.

8. **Document Exploitation Process:**
   - Recorded the steps taken during login attempts and password reset testing.
   - Documented any successful authentication or session manipulation.

9. **Report Findings:**
   - Notified instructor of successful Broken Authentication exploitation.
   - Provided details of authentication points tested, actions attempted, and observed impact.

## Next Steps:
Proceed to Requirement 7 - Exploit an Improper Input Validation vulnerability.
